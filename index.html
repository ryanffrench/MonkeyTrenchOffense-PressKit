    <div class="about">
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>In our game you play as a balloon trying to escape evil 
monkeys that have trapped you and your fellow balloons. You must dodge 
the projectile attacks from numerous monkeys like bomb monkeys that 
throw massive amounts of TNT at you, dart monkeys that throw needle 
sharp arrows, and ice monkeys that hurl freezing icicles. With no 
ability to fight back, your only options are to run, dash, and 
outmaneuver the relentless attacks. The further you progress, the more 
challenging the enemies and obstacles become as you strive for freedom.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="controls">
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arrow Keys / WASD:</strong> Use these keys to move your balloon in any direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Up / W:</strong> Move Up</li>
            <li><strong>Down / S:</strong> Move Down</li>
            <li><strong>Left / A:</strong> Move Left</li>
            <li><strong>Right / D:</strong> Move Right</li>
            <li><strong>Spacebar:</strong> Use the spacebar to dash 
quickly in the direction you're moving. This will help you evade 
incoming attacks, but use it wisely, as the dash has a cooldown period.</li>
            <li><strong>E:</strong> Cycle Through Upgrades (test input)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="strategy">
        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dodge and Dash:</strong> Your main defense is 
your ability to move and dash. Keep an eye on the approaching enemies 
and their projectiles. Time your dash carefully to avoid explosions, 
arrows, and icicles.</li>
            <li><strong>Enemy Patterns:</strong> Different monkeys throw
 different types of projectiles, each with its own behavior. Bomb 
monkeys will throw large TNT that explode after a short delay, dart 
monkeys will shoot fast arrows in predictable patterns, and ice monkeys 
will throw icicles that slow you down. Learn their patterns and use your
 dash strategically to evade them.</li>
            <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> Always keep an eye on the 
terrain and use it to your advantage. Some areas may provide more room 
to maneuver, while others might be more dangerous due to tight spaces 
and numerous enemies.</li>
            <li><strong>Use the Dash Sparingly:</strong> The dash is a 
powerful tool, but it has a cooldown period. Use it when you absolutely 
need to escape or quickly change direction. Overusing it may leave you 
vulnerable.</li>
            <li><strong>Level Progression:</strong> Each level gets 
progressively more difficult with additional enemies and faster 
projectiles. Stay alert and adapt your strategy as the challenges 
increase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Good luck, and may you escape the monkeysâ€™ clutches!</p>
